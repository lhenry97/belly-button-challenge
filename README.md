# belly-button-challenge
The following challenge was completed as apart of the week 14 challenge of the Data Analytics Bootcamp. 
A belly button dataset (http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/) which analysed the presences of microbial species (also known as operational taxonomic units (OTUs)) in people. 
An app was created that parsed the data and created two graphs that displayed the top 10 microbial species present and bacterial cultures per sample in each test subject. 
A git hub page was created to display the data using the index.html file.
